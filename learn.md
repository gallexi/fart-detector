By building a working fart detector with your Raspberry Pi you will:

- Understand the difference between analogue and digital
- Understand binary counting
- Understand voltage, current and resistance
- Understand how an air quality sensor works
- Understand fart potency
- Make a rudimentary DAC (digital to analogue converter) 
- Gain experience in Python programming
- Gain experience using the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
- [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/developer)
- [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create prototype projects](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/builder)
